        <p class="para">My main hobby is astronomy and more recently astrophotography. I have not had a lot of time to use my telescope since I left for college, but I continue to read astronomy related news articles and watch astronomy related videos. My interest in astronomy was sparked during my freshman year of high school when my dad bought me a telescope and we took it to my high school at night to look at the moon and some close planets. I have also loved puzzles from an early age, and one of my favorite puzzles is the Rubikâ€™s Cube.
